## Key Components of a Nagios Enterprise Installation

In an enterprise environment, a robust Nagios implementation extends beyond the core monitoring engine, incorporating several key components to ensure comprehensive and scalable oversight of the IT infrastructure. These components work in concert to monitor a wide array of systems and services, manage distributed environments, and provide insightful data for analysis and reporting.

### Core Components

At the heart of any Nagios setup are the fundamental building blocks that provide the primary monitoring and alerting functionalities.

* **Nagios Core:** This is the central processing engine of the Nagios monitoring system. It is responsible for scheduling and executing checks on various hosts and services, processing the results of those checks, and triggering notifications when problems are detected or resolved. Nagios Core itself does not perform any monitoring; it relies on plugins to do the actual work.

* **Nagios Plugins:** These are external scripts and executables that Nagios Core uses to check the status of a host or service. There are thousands of plugins available, both official and community-contributed, which can monitor everything from network protocols (SMTP, HTTP, etc.) and system metrics (CPU load, disk usage) to specific applications. The modularity of plugins allows Nagios to be highly extensible and monitor virtually any device or service.

* **Web Interface:** A web-based graphical user interface is essential for visualizing the monitored environment. While Nagios Core includes a basic CGI-based interface, many enterprise deployments utilize more advanced and user-friendly interfaces such as Nagios XI, Thruk, or NagVis. These interfaces provide dashboards, reporting capabilities, and configuration front-ends, making it easier for administrators to manage the monitoring system and for stakeholders to view the status of critical services.

### Remote Monitoring and Agents

To monitor remote systems and services, especially those behind firewalls or in different network segments, Nagios relies on agents and specific protocols.

* **Nagios Remote Plugin Executor (NRPE):** A widely used agent for monitoring remote Linux/Unix systems. NRPE consists of a daemon that runs on the remote machine and a plugin that resides on the Nagios server. The Nagios server uses the `check_nrpe` plugin to command the NRPE daemon on the remote host to execute a specific monitoring plugin locally. This allows for the monitoring of local resources like CPU load, memory, and disk space that are not typically exposed to the network.

* **Nagios Cross-Platform Agent (NCPA):** A more modern and flexible agent that can monitor a variety of operating systems, including Linux, Windows, and macOS. NCPA offers a web-based GUI for easy configuration and provides both active and passive checking capabilities. It has a built-in API that allows for more sophisticated and customized monitoring scenarios.

### Data Persistence and Reporting

In an enterprise setting, it's crucial to store and analyze historical monitoring data for trend analysis, capacity planning, and SLA reporting.

* **Nagios Data Out Bins (NDOutils):** This addon is a critical component for storing monitoring data in a database. NDOutils consists of two parts: a broker module that runs alongside the Nagios Core engine and a daemon that takes the data from the broker and inserts it into a MySQL or PostgreSQL database. Storing this data in a database enables more powerful reporting and allows other applications to access the historical monitoring information.

### Scalability and Distributed Monitoring

For large and geographically dispersed infrastructures, a single Nagios server may not be sufficient. Distributed monitoring components are essential for scalability and resilience.

* **Nagios Fusion:** This is a commercial tool that provides a centralized view of multiple Nagios Core or Nagios XI instances. It allows administrators to see the status of all their monitored infrastructure from a single dashboard, providing a consolidated view for large organizations.

* **Nagios Mod Gearman:** This is an addon that distributes the workload of executing checks across multiple worker machines. By offloading the execution of checks from the central Nagios server, Mod Gearman can significantly improve the performance and scalability of the monitoring environment, allowing for the monitoring of tens of thousands of hosts and services.

i want to create a repo server for redhat, the purpose is to connect that machine to internet updat ethe rpms and the make it offline but then use it internally as the repo server for all oother redhat machines, how do I ensure that I have all the rpms placed where they should be 



To ensure all the RPMs for your offline Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) repository are correctly in place, you'll need to follow a methodical process of synchronizing the official Red Hat repositories, creating the necessary metadata, and then hosting them on your internal network. This guide will walk you through setting up a comprehensive local repository that your other offline RHEL machines can use for updates and package installations.

### **Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

  * **An Internet-Connected RHEL Machine:** This machine will be used to download all the necessary packages from the Red Hat Content Delivery Network (CDN). It must have a valid Red Hat subscription.
  * **Sufficient Storage:** The size of the RHEL repositories can be substantial (hundreds of gigabytes). Ensure the machine has enough disk space to store all the downloaded RPMs.
  * **An Offline Server:** This will be your internal repository server. It does not need a direct internet connection but must be accessible to your other internal RHEL clients.
  * **Web Server Software:** You'll need a web server like Apache (`httpd`) to serve the repository files to your client machines.

-----

### **Step 1: Synchronize the Red Hat Repositories**

The first step is to download all the desired RPM packages from the official Red Hat repositories to your internet-connected RHEL machine. The `reposync` command is the primary tool for this task.

1.  **Install Necessary Tools:**
    If not already installed, install the `yum-utils` package which provides the `reposync` tool, and `createrepo` for generating repository metadata.

    ```bash
    sudo dnf install yum-utils createrepo
    ```

2.  **Identify Available Repositories:**
    List all the enabled repositories on your subscribed RHEL machine to see what you can sync.

    ```bash
    sudo dnf repolist
    ```

    You will see a list of repository IDs (e.g., `rhel-9-for-x86_64-baseos-rpms`, `rhel-9-for-x86_64-appstream-rpms`).

3.  **Create a Directory for Your Repositories:**
    Choose a location on your filesystem with ample space to store the downloaded packages.

    ```bash
    sudo mkdir -p /var/www/html/rhel9-repo
    ```

4.  **Synchronize the Repositories:**
    Use `reposync` to download all the packages from the repositories you identified. To sync all enabled repositories, you can run:

    ```bash
    sudo reposync -p /var/www/html/rhel9-repo
    ```

    If you only want specific repositories, use the `--repoid` flag for each one:

    ```bash
    sudo reposync -p /var/www/html/rhel9-repo --repoid=rhel-9-for-x86_64-baseos-rpms --repoid=rhel-9-for-x86_64-appstream-rpms
    ```

    This process can take a significant amount of time and will download all packages from the specified repositories into subdirectories within `/var/www/html/rhel9-repo`.

-----

### **Step 2: Create the Repository Metadata**

After downloading the packages, you need to create the repository metadata. This metadata is what `DNF` or `YUM` on your client machines will read to understand what packages are available in your local repository.

1.  **Navigate to the Repository Directory:**
    Change into the directory where you downloaded the repositories.

    ```bash
    cd /var/www/html/rhel9-repo
    ```

2.  **Generate Metadata for Each Repository:**
    You will need to run the `createrepo` command for each of the repository directories that `reposync` created.

    ```bash
    sudo createrepo /var/www/html/rhel9-repo/rhel-9-for-x86_64-baseos-rpms
    sudo createrepo /var/www/html/rhel9-repo/rhel-9-for-x86_64-appstream-rpms
    ```

    Repeat this for every repository you synchronized. This command creates a `repodata` directory within each repository folder containing the necessary metadata files.

    To update the metadata after adding new packages later, you can use the `--update` flag:

    ```bash
    sudo createrepo --update /var/www/html/rhel9-repo/rhel-9-for-x86_64-baseos-rpms
    ```

-----

### **Step 3: Configure the Web Server**

Now you'll set up a web server on your repository machine to make the RPMs and metadata available to your internal network. Apache (`httpd`) is a common choice.

1.  **Install and Start Apache:**

    ```bash
    sudo dnf install httpd
    sudo systemctl start httpd
    sudo systemctl enable httpd
    ```

2.  **Configure Firewall Rules:**
    Allow HTTP traffic through the firewall.

    ```bash
    sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=http --permanent
    sudo firewall-cmd --reload
    ```

3.  **Verify Web Server Access:**
    From another machine on your internal network, try to access the web server by navigating to `http://<your-repo-server-ip>`. You should see the Apache test page. You should also be able to browse to `http://<your-repo-server-ip>/rhel9-repo/`.

-----

### **Step 4: Configure Your Offline Client Machines**

The final step is to configure your offline RHEL client machines to use your newly created internal repository.

1.  **Create a New Repository Configuration File:**
    On each client machine, create a new `.repo` file in the `/etc/yum.repos.d/` directory. It's a good practice to move any existing `.repo` files out of this directory to avoid conflicts.

    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/yum.repos.d/internal.repo
    ```

2.  **Add the Repository Configuration:**
    Add entries in this file for each repository you are hosting. The `baseurl` should point to the corresponding directory on your repository server.

    ```ini
    [internal-baseos]
    name=Internal RHEL 9 - BaseOS
    baseurl=http://<your-repo-server-ip>/rhel9-repo/rhel-9-for-x86_64-baseos-rpms
    enabled=1
    gpgcheck=0

    [internal-appstream]
    name=Internal RHEL 9 - AppStream
    baseurl=http://<your-repo-server-ip>/rhel9-repo/rhel-9-for-x86_64-appstream-rpms
    enabled=1
    gpgcheck=0
    ```

    **Note:** In this example, `gpgcheck` is set to `0` for simplicity. For a production environment, you should import the Red Hat GPG keys to your client machines and set `gpgcheck=1`.

3.  **Clean the DNF/YUM Cache and Verify:**
    On the client machines, clear the package manager's cache and then list the enabled repositories to ensure it's pointing to your internal server.

    ```bash
    sudo dnf clean all
    sudo dnf repolist
    ```

    You should now see `internal-baseos` and `internal-appstream` in the list. You can now install and update packages on your offline machines using `dnf`.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
exaplin in detail how can a linux machine become repository for another machine 


Of course\! A Linux machine can act as a software repository for other machines by hosting package files and the necessary metadata files that package managers like `apt` (for Debian/Ubuntu) or `dnf`/`yum` (for RHEL/CentOS/Fedora) use to find and install software.

This is extremely useful for:

  * **Offline Networks**: Providing updates to machines in an air-gapped or isolated network.
  * **Consistency**: Ensuring all machines use the exact same approved versions of software.
  * **Bandwidth Savings**: Caching packages locally so they don't need to be downloaded from the internet repeatedly.
  * **Custom Software**: Distributing your own internally developed `.deb` or `.rpm` packages.

The process involves three main steps:

1.  **Host the Files**: Set up a web server (like Nginx or Apache) to make the package files accessible over the network.
2.  **Generate Metadata**: Create special index files that tell the client's package manager what packages are available in your repository.
3.  **Configure the Client**: Tell the client machines to look at your new server for packages.

Here’s a detailed breakdown for the two major Linux families.

-----

### For Debian-based Systems (like Ubuntu)

On the **server machine**, you'll use tools like `dpkg-dev` and a web server. Let's use **Nginx**.

#### 1\. Server: Setup and Hosting

First, install the necessary tools and create a directory to hold your packages.

```bash
# Install Nginx (a lightweight web server) and tools for creating the repository
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx dpkg-dev

# Create a directory to store your .deb package files
# This path is served by Nginx by default
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/html/my-ubuntu-repo

# Grant proper permissions
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/html/my-ubuntu-repo
```

Now, **copy all the `.deb` files** you want to host into the `/var/www/html/my-ubuntu-repo` directory.

#### 2\. Server: Generate Repository Metadata

The `apt` package manager needs a `Packages.gz` file that lists all the available packages and their details.

```bash
# Navigate to your repository directory
cd /var/www/html/my-ubuntu-repo

# Generate the Packages file and compress it
dpkg-scanpackages . | gzip > Packages.gz
```

> **Important**: Every time you add or remove a `.deb` file from this directory, you **must re-run this command** to update the metadata.

#### 3\. Client: Configuration

On another machine (the client), you need to tell `apt` where to find your new repository.

First, you need the server's IP address. You can find it on the server with `ip a`. Let's assume the server's IP is `192.168.1.100`.

Create a new source list file on the **client machine**:

```bash
# Create a new file in the sources.list.d directory
sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/my-local-repo.list
```

Add the following line to the file, replacing the IP address with your server's IP:

```
deb [trusted=yes] http://192.168.1.100/my-ubuntu-repo ./
```

> **Note**: `[trusted=yes]` is used here for simplicity. In a production environment, you should sign your repository with a GPG key for security. 🔒

Finally, update `apt`'s cache on the client. It will now read from your local repository.

```bash
sudo apt update
```

You can now install any package you placed on the server, like `sudo apt install my-custom-package`.

-----

### For Red Hat-based Systems (like CentOS, Fedora, RHEL)

On the **server machine**, the key tool is `createrepo`, and you'll again use a web server like **Nginx**.

#### 1\. Server: Setup and Hosting

First, install the necessary tools and create the directory.

```bash
# Install Nginx and the createrepo utility
sudo dnf install nginx createrepo -y

# Start and enable Nginx to run on boot
sudo systemctl start nginx
sudo systemctl enable nginx

# Create a directory to store your .rpm package files
sudo mkdir -p /usr/share/nginx/html/my-centos-repo

# Grant proper permissions
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /usr/share/nginx/html/my-centos-repo

# Also, ensure SELinux and firewalls allow access
sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=http --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

Now, **copy all your `.rpm` files** into the `/usr/share/nginx/html/my-centos-repo` directory.

#### 2\. Server: Generate Repository Metadata

The `dnf` package manager looks for a directory named `repodata`. The `createrepo` command generates this for you.

```bash
# Run createrepo on your package directory
createrepo /usr/share/nginx/html/my-centos-repo
```

This command creates the `repodata` subdirectory with all the necessary metadata.

> **Important**: Just like with Debian, every time you add or remove an `.rpm` file, you must re-run this command. To update an existing repository, you can use: `createrepo --update /usr/share/nginx/html/my-centos-repo`.

#### 3\. Client: Configuration

On the **client machine**, you configure a new repository by creating a `.repo` file in `/etc/yum.repos.d/`.

Let's assume the server IP is `192.168.1.100`.

```bash
# Create and edit a new .repo file
sudo nano /etc/yum.repos.d/my-local-repo.repo
```

Add the following content to the file:

```ini
[my-local-repo]
name=My Local CentOS Repository
baseurl=http://192.168.1.100/my-centos-repo/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
```

> **Note**: `gpgcheck=0` disables the security signature check. For production, you should sign your RPMs and set this to `1` along with a `gpgkey=` URL. 🔒

Finally, clean the `dnf` cache and verify that it sees your new repository.

```bash
# Clean all caches
sudo dnf clean all

# List enabled repositories; you should see "my-local-repo"
sudo dnf repolist
```

You can now install packages from your server, like `sudo dnf install my-custom-package`.


















----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



You can find Nagios package dependencies using your system's package manager. The commands differ slightly depending on your Linux distribution.

-----

## For Debian/Ubuntu and derivatives (using APT)

To see the dependencies for the `nagios4` package, you can use the `apt-cache` command:

```bash
apt-cache depends nagios4
```

This will list all the packages that `nagios4` depends on to function correctly.

-----

## For CentOS/RHEL and derivatives (using YUM or DNF)

If you're using a Red Hat-based system, you can use either `yum` or the newer `dnf` command to view dependencies.

**Using YUM:**

```bash
yum deplist nagios
```

**Using DNF:**

```bash
dnf deplist nagios
```

Both commands will provide a list of the Nagios package's dependencies and the providers for those dependencies.

-----

## If you installed from source

If you compiled and installed Nagios from source code instead of using a package manager, the dependencies would have been listed in the installation documentation or a `README` file within the source code directory. You would have needed to install these manually before compiling. The configure script (`./configure`) would have also checked for these dependencies and alerted you to any missing packages.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------









give me a detailed tutorial on redhat image builder with command examples 




Of course. Here is a detailed tutorial on how to use Red Hat Image Builder from the command line on RHEL 8 or RHEL 9.

This tutorial will guide you through creating a customized **qcow2** image, which is a common format for virtual machines, suitable for KVM/QEMU, OpenStack, and other hypervisors.

-----

### Prerequisites: Installation and Service Setup

First, you need to install the Image Builder packages and start the service.

1.  **Install the necessary packages:**

    ```bash
    sudo dnf install osbuild-composer composer-cli
    ```

2.  **Enable and start the service:**

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl enable --now osbuild-composer.socket
    ```

3.  **Verify the service status:**

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl status osbuild-composer
    ```

    You should see that it's active and running.

-----

### Step 1: Create a Blueprint

A **blueprint** is a TOML file that defines what your final image will contain. It specifies the packages, users, services, and other configurations.

1.  **Create a blueprint file.** Let's name it `webserver.toml`.

    ```bash
    nano webserver.toml
    ```

2.  **Add content to the file.** This example creates an image for a basic Nginx web server. It includes the Nginx package, creates a custom user, and sets the hostname.

    ```toml
    # Blueprint for a basic RHEL 9 web server
    name = "rhel9-webserver"
    description = "A custom RHEL 9 image with Nginx"
    version = "1.0.0"

    # Define custom packages to be installed
    [[packages]]
    name = "nginx"
    version = "*"

    [[packages]]
    name = "git"
    version = "*"

    # Define system customizations
    [customizations]
    hostname = "web-server-01"

    # Create a custom user account
    [[customizations.user]]
    name = "webapp_admin"
    description = "Web Application Admin"
    password = "$6$GRp.pINe/y1K.Vb0$ifCOnJg8Tza9hJ9fIfLhH2wU2VlT5gex2a/SBEaO3jAPNIb5Tdw3LgXfTJk3I51AIvnnILsV32tSEg40xVYYp."
    key = "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAICjMGcXL1fj4Rsoi5pBy4yJppFi3Awns4OF22E26z2Jl user@example.com"
    home = "/home/webapp_admin"
    groups = ["wheel"]
    ```

    > **💡 Pro Tip:** To generate the password hash, use the command:
    > `python3 -c 'import crypt; print(crypt.crypt("YourPasswordHere"))'`

-----

### Step 2: Push the Blueprint to Image Builder

Image Builder needs to know about your blueprint definition. You "push" or save the `.toml` file to the Image Builder service.

1.  **Push the blueprint:**

    ```bash
    sudo composer-cli blueprints push webserver.toml
    ```

    You should see a confirmation that the blueprint was saved.

2.  **Verify the blueprint is listed:**

    ```bash
    sudo composer-cli blueprints list
    ```

    You will see `rhel9-webserver` in the list.

3.  **Check the contents of the blueprint (optional):**

    ```bash
    sudo composer-cli blueprints show rhel9-webserver
    ```

-----

### Step 3: Start the Image Build (Compose)

Now you can tell Image Builder to start "composing" (building) the image based on your blueprint.

1.  **Start the compose process.** You need to specify the blueprint name (`rhel9-webserver`) and the desired image type (`qcow2`).

    ```bash
    sudo composer-cli compose start rhel9-webserver qcow2
    ```

    This command will return a unique ID (UUID) for your build. **Copy this UUID.**

    Example output:
    `Compose 208c37d6-75b2-4d88-a25e-5618b7d27e7f added to the queue`

2.  **Monitor the build status.** Use the UUID from the previous step to check the progress. The status will go from `WAITING` to `RUNNING` to `FINISHED` (or `FAILED`).

    ```bash
    sudo composer-cli compose status
    ```

    This shows the status of all current and past builds. Look for your UUID.

    \!([https://i.imgur.com/8Q9r8uC.png](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://i.imgur.com/8Q9r8uC.png))

-----

### Step 4: Download the Image

Once the build status is `FINISHED`, you can download the resulting image file.

1.  **Download the `.qcow2` file.** Use the build's UUID. The image is saved as a `.tar` archive which contains the `qcow2` file.

    ```bash
    sudo composer-cli compose image <YOUR_UUID_HERE>
    ```

    For example:

    ```bash
    sudo composer-cli compose image 208c37d6-75b2-4d88-a25e-5618b7d27e7f
    ```

    This will save a file named after the UUID with a `.tar` extension (e.g., `208c37d6-75b2-4d88-a25e-5618b7d27e7f.tar`).

2.  **Extract the image:**

    ```bash
    tar -xf <YOUR_UUID_HERE>.tar
    ```

    Inside you will find your `disk.qcow2` file, which is your new, customized virtual machine image. You can now rename it and use it to create a VM.




is it true that kickstart can you two different kind of sources to create output , ohne is a ready image like a qcow2 made by image builder and the other one is a generic iso file for the OS 



Yes, that's a great way to look at it. You're correct that Kickstart operates in two fundamentally different scenarios depending on the source you use.

---
## 1. Source: A Generic OS ISO File

This is the **classic, traditional use case** for Kickstart.

In this scenario, Kickstart automates the Anaconda installer. The installer boots from a generic RHEL ISO file (or a network mirror of its contents) and reads the Kickstart file for instructions. The Kickstart file tells the installer how to partition the disk, what package groups to install from the ISO's repositories, what users to create, etc.

* **Analogy:** You're giving a chef (**Anaconda installer**) a detailed recipe (**Kickstart file**) and a pantry full of raw ingredients (**the ISO file**) to cook a meal from scratch.



---
## 2. Source: A Ready-Made Image (like a qcow2)

This is the more **modern, image-based workflow.**

Here, you've already done the heavy lifting with a tool like **Red Hat Image Builder** to create a highly customized, ready-to-run disk image (a `qcow2`, `vmdk`, etc.).

Kickstart isn't used to build the OS from packages in this case. Instead, a very minimal Kickstart file might be used simply to automate the process of **deploying** that image to bare-metal hardware. The script's main job would be to partition the disk and then, in a `%post` section, copy the pre-built `qcow2` image directly onto the new partition. The source isn't an ISO repository, but the image file itself located on a network share.

* **Analogy:** You're giving a worker (**minimal Kickstart script**) a fully prepared, pre-cooked meal (**the qcow2 image**) with a simple instruction: "Put this meal on this plate (**the server's disk**)."

So, while both scenarios use Kickstart, its role changes dramatically: from a detailed **OS builder** to a simple **image deployer**.






give me command examples of both scenarios 




Of course. Here are command examples that illustrate both Kickstart scenarios.

-----

## 1\. Using a Generic ISO (The Classic Method)

In this scenario, you're telling the installer where to find the Kickstart file on the network. The command is often used to create a new VM. Here we use `virt-install`, a common tool for creating KVM virtual machines.

The key part is the `-x` or `--extra-args` flag, which passes kernel arguments to the installer. We use it to specify the location of our `ks.cfg` file.

**Command Example:**

```bash
virt-install \
--name rhel9-vm-from-iso \
--ram 4096 \
--vcpus 2 \
--disk path=/var/lib/libvirt/images/rhel9-vm.qcow2,size=20 \
--os-variant rhel9.4 \
--location /home/user/Downloads/rhel-9.4-x86_64-dvd.iso \
--extra-args "inst.ks=http://192.168.122.1/ks/webserver.cfg console=ttyS0" \
--network bridge=virbr0
```

### Breakdown of the Kickstart-related line:

  * `--extra-args`: Passes arguments directly to the installer's kernel.
  * `"inst.ks=http://.../webserver.cfg"`: This is the crucial part. It tells the Anaconda installer to fetch its instructions from the Kickstart file located at that web address.
  * `console=ttyS0`: This directs the installer's output to the virtual serial console, which is helpful for automation and debugging.

-----

## 2\. Deploying a Ready-Made Image

Here, the Kickstart file itself contains the logic to download and write the pre-built image. You would still boot a minimal installation environment (like a live ISO), but the Kickstart file does all the work in the post-installation section.

**Kickstart File Example (`deploy-image.cfg`):**

```bash
# Kickstart file for deploying a pre-built qcow2 image
# Basic setup commands to get the system ready for the image copy
clearpart --all --initlabel
part / --fstype="xfs" --grow --size=1

# The %post section runs after the basic environment is set up.
%post --log=/root/ks-post.log
#!/bin/bash

# Target disk to write the image to
TARGET_DISK="/dev/vda"

# The URL of the pre-built image created by Image Builder
IMAGE_URL="http://192.168.122.1/images/rhel9-webserver.qcow2"

echo "Downloading image from $IMAGE_URL..."
# Use curl to download the image and pipe it directly to dd to write to the disk
curl -L $IMAGE_URL | dd of=$TARGET_DISK bs=8M

echo "Image deployment complete. Rebooting..."
# Note: In a real-world scenario, you might do more, like expand the filesystem.
%end

# Reboot after the %post script is finished
reboot
```

### How You'd Use This File:

You would use the same `virt-install` command as in the first example, but you would point it to this new `deploy-image.cfg` file. The installer would boot, partition the disk as minimally as possible, and then execute the `%post` script which overwrites that same disk with your golden image.
